# Tutorial
## 1. Create Tileset (in Tilemill)

### Step 0:
Grab and install [Tilemill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/), if you haven't done so already. If this is new to you: Tilemill is an application by the amazing team at [Mapbox](mapbox.com), where you can style vector files and export the images (called tiles) to build a map.

And If you haven't heard about Mapbox, then check it out their [website](mapbox.com) and [blog](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/).


### Step 1: Create a new Project
Once everything is set up, we can start.

Add a new project:
![add new project](assets/step_01_newProject.png)

Set a name for your project and untick the "Default data"-checkbox, because we are creating a map from scratch.
![set project details](assets/step_02_projectDetails.png)

This is what you should end up with:
![blank project](assets/step_03_blankProject.png)


### Step 2: Import shapefile (or geojson)
The first real step is to import the shapefile (or geojson). If you haven't heard about shapefiles (or geojson) before â€“ it's  [short description]

Open layer menu and **add a new layer**.
![add new layer](assets/step_04_addLayer.png)

**Browse Datasource** and select the **"countries.shp"** file from the tutorial folder. You don't have to configure anything else, so press **"Save & Style"**.
![select shapefile (or geojson) as datasource](assets/step_05_layerDetails.png)

You will end up with something like that:
![preview](assets/step_06_basicStyle.png)
**Note:** The layer-name is already inserted, but you can always check the name in the layer menu at the bottom left.

### Step 3: Style your Map
Mapbox provides a [great tutorial](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/crashcourse/styling/) on how to style maps with tilemill, or use our style and follow the tutorial:

    Map {
      background-color: #fff;
    }

    #countries {
      line-color:#D8D8D8;
      line-width:1;
      polygon-fill:#fff;
    }
    
![Step 8](assets/step_07_advancedStyle.png)

### Optional Step: Add UTF-8 Grid

**Note:** A UTF-8 grid adds the possibility to add hover events to a map. Our example shows the country's name, abbreviation and population. But this will also increase the size of your tileset, so only add this if you need it. [This article](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/how-interactivity-works-utfgrid/) by Mapbox does a good job explaining the UTF8 grid functionality.

Enable Interactivity for hover events.
![define interactivity](assets/step_08_addInteractivity.png)

Add the [mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) template.
For our shape file the data will look like following, but you can inspect the data for each layer in the layer menu (bottom left):

    Country Name: {{{ADMIN}}} <br>
    Country Abbreviation: {{{ne_10m_adm}}} <br>
    Country Population: {{{POP_EST}}}
![Step 8](assets/step_09_addMustache.png)

If you now hover over a country. It will show the text you defined with the mustache template, filled with the data from the shape file.
![Step 8](assets/step_10_testHover.png)

### Step 4: Export Map
Hit "Export" and select "MBtiles" as a file format.
![export as mbtiles](assets/step_11_exportTiles.png)

Set tile name and zoom factor. **Note** Select a small range of zoom, to keep your tile size small.
![export as mbtiles](assets/step_12_exportDetails.png)

This will take a while. Once it's done: Save it and move the ".mbtiles"-file ...
![save mbtiles file](assets/step_13_save.png)

... into the "data"-folder of your Tilehut directory to look like following:
![move tiles](assets/step_14_result.png)

## 2. Run Tile Server
### Option 1: Via Localhost
Open the **Terminal**, navigate to the tilehut folder and run `node server.js` to serve the files. As you can see, your server is now running at <http://localhost:8000/>
![sdsfgv](assets/step_15_startServer.png)

**Note:** You can inspect tilesets (even unknown ones) by opening them in your **browser**, e.g. <http://localhost:8000/tiles-world-simple/map/>. This works for normal raster tiles, as well as utf8 tiles and even vector tiles.

![sdsfgv](assets/step_16_mapPreview.png)

You can use [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) to display maps in the browser. Check out our example files in `tilehut/examples/`

### Option 2: Via OpenShift
[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) is a service, where you can set up a cloud-based application. The Basic functionality is free.

#### Step 0: Learn Git
Openshift is using Git. If you don't know what Git means: basically Git is used to keep track of your files. No "file_v4_final_reallyfinal.png"-files anymore and you can always go back in time.
 
[Github](https://try.github.io/) has a fun introduction into Git, and [this guy](http://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/) did a nice writeup why you should use somekind version control (there are alternatives to git). So if you don't know anything about it. Now is the time.

#### Step 1: Create New Project
Log into [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/) or create an account and create a new project. 
Select Application-type: **Node.js** and fill out the rest. If you are new to Openshift, there is a [beginner's guide](https://developers.openshift.com/en/getting-started-overview.html) for you.

![move tiles](assets/step_17_openshiftApplication.png)

#### Step 2: Set up repository Repository
You can either way just push the tilehut repository onto Openshift or clone the repo and add the files you need. Grab the ssh-key from your application site on Openshift.

     git clone ssh://somekey@projectname-youropenshiftdomain.rhcloud.com/~/git/projectname.git/
     
or:

     git push openshift master --force
     

#### Step 3: Check the Status
go to `http://projectname-youropenshiftdomain.rhcloud.com/ping` and check if the server returns "tilehut says pong!". 

If it does you are almost there. If it doesn't the repository hasn't been synced probably. But you can check that also via FTP (see next step).
![sdsfgv](assets/step_20_pingPong.png)

#### Step 4: Add tiles via FTP
Connect via FTP to Openshift. There is a [quick Tutorial](http://www.openshifttutorial.cu.cc/access-to-openshift-through-sftp/) on how to conenct via Cyberduck, but it will work with Filezilla or every other FTP client as well.

Navigate to `app-root/data/`inside openshift and paste there the tilesets you want to use.
![sdsfgv](assets/step_21_cyberDuck.png)

**Note:** The reason why this folder is empty is how cloud computing works. If you want to serve tiles on a grand scale you should set up a seperate server, because now the tiles would not be mirrored properly if you'd set up a scalable project. It's enough for our purpose, so we keep it simple.

#### Step 5: Test the Tiles
goto `http://project-youropenshiftdomain.rhcloud.com/name-of-tileset/map` and look at the beautiful map you just hosted. You can now use them in your website or anywhere else. Check out our example files.
